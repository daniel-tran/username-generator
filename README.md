# Username Generator
A program that generates usernames. Made using C++ (or was it C?).

## What should the program do?
A semi-random username is provided based on a general format specified by the user.
e.g. "wSw" indicates two generic words separated by a space.

## Why did you make this? There are already solutions to this problem!
The idea of this project is mostly to get back into C/C++, as it's been a while since I've developed anything using this language.
Most notably, I'd like to remember how to use C pointers and memory allocation. It might come in handy down th line...

Also, I think this is a good opportunity to learn about the Git BASH option for source control and updating the project remotely.

## How long do you think you'll be working on this project?
Hopefully, I'll make some progress and get this finished by the end of the year.
Worst case scenario, you'll just have a badly documented code base that works.
